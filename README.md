# HansenWoodyardEndFireArray

This repository is part of my term paper focusing on the Hansen Woodyard (HW) End-Fire array.
It is an exploration of the array design, comparison to the ordinary end-fire array, and analysis of modern optimization methods for the HW array. 

The .mlx files are to a sense sandboxes where I messed around with the equations for antenna arrays.
