# HansenWoodyardEndFireArray

This repository is part of my term paper focusing on the Hansen Woodyard (HW) End-Fire array.
It is an exploration of the array design, comparison to the ordinary end-fire array, and analysis of modern optimization methods for the HW array. 

EndFireVsOrdinary.mlx: File used to compare the ordinary end fire design and the Hansen-Woodyard end fire design.
GradientDescent.m: Gradient descent implementation focusing on reducing the backlobe of the Hansen-Woodyard design.

The .mlx files are to a sense sandboxes where I messed around with the equations for antenna arrays.

Relevant Papers to be uploaded as they are all on my other computer.
